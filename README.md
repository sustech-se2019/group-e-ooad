### Scenario test: [link](Test.md)
## 1. Choose 3 features to implement for this iteration. 

### 1.(a)

> List the 3 features that you have chosen. Explain the reason for choosing this feature? Hint: Your answer can be based on either (1) importance of the feature; or (3) dependencies between features; or (2) the ease of constructing test cases but you need to explain in more details (for example, I choose feature A because A is the most important part of the main screen). (Total: 6 points, 2 points for each feature & reason)

**1.(a).1: Login/Register **

Login and register are fundamentally functions. An news application should have an account for identification, it is important for us to recommend news. So we choose it to implement. 

**1.(a).2: Camera**

Using camera to enrich personal information, the rich account information is necessary to user's experience.

**1.(a).3: Share**

By providing users the feature to share news they like to other people through this application, we can attract more potential users.

### 1.(b)

> Write 2 test scenario for each feature. These test cases serves as the specification for each feature (Example positive test scenario: “When user login successfully to her account, a “Welcome” dialog box is 
> shown”. Example negative test scenario: “When user login with an incorrect userid/password, the user will get an error message saying “Incorrect message”). You should commit the test scenario in the README.md. (Total: 12 point, 2 points for each test scenario)

**This part is in the front-end test markdown file.**

### 1.(c)

> Implement all the 3 features that you have chosen. (Total: 12 points, 4 points for each feature implemented)

**The three features referenced in 1.(a) have been implemented.**

### 1.(d)

> Run Checkstyle, FindBugs, and PMD for all the submitted code. Make sure that you follow the Google coding standards for your project. For Checkstyle, change your code so that there is no serious errors (severity=”error”). For FindBugs, change your code so that there is no error with priority=”Medium” and priority=”High”. For PMD, change your code so that there is no error left. Note that the TA will randomly choose a team member to run these tools so if the team member doesn’t how to run these plugins, 5 points will be deducted for the whole team so please help your team member in the installation and
> the usage of the tool.

### 1.(e)

>   Write meaningful Javadoc comments for each public method. Read https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7-javadoc for information about the coding standard for Javadoc. (Total: 5 points, 1 point will be deducted for each public method that are not documented.). 

Javadoc has been written in the code part.

### 1.(f)

>    Write >=2 JUnit tests for each public method in all your  classes. 

JUnit test  are in test files, GUI scenerio tests are in Test.md.

### 1.(g)

>   Include a schedule for each week after April 20 to plan for your remaining features. It is recommended to plan for two features per week and one feature for Week 15 (Need to prepare final release of the app). 

| Week 10 | News Details                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Week 11 | News "like", "unlike", "bookmark" features. |
| Week 12 | Spider for news.                            |
